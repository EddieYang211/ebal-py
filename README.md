# Entropy Balancing for Binary and Continuous Treatment

Python implementation of Entropy Balancing for binary and continuous treatment

> Author: Eddie Yang

ebal for binary treatment is based on Hainmueller ([2012](https://web.stanford.edu/~jhain/Paper/PA2012.pdf)) and ebal for continuous treatment is based on Tübbicke ([2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.06281)) and Vegetabile et al. ([2021](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02938.pdf)).


## Examples

```
# Binary
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('~/data.csv')

treatment="treat"
tmp_df = df[df[treatment].isin([0, 1])]
tmp_df = tmp_df.sort_values(by=[treatment])
tmp_df = tmp_df.reset_index(drop=True)

Y = tmp_df.Y.values
X = tmp_df.loc[:,0:10]                         #features
T = tmp_df[treatment].values                   #treatment
e = ebal_bin()
out = e.ebalance(T, X, Y)

# print ebal-weighted regression result
out['wls'].summary()

# check post-wegihting balance between treatment and control groups
e.check_balance(X, T, out['w'])
```

```
# Continuous
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('~/data_cont.csv')

Y = df.Y.values
X = df.iloc[:,4:]                         #features
T = df.T.values                           #treatment

e = ebal_con()
out = e.ebalance(T, X)

# check post-wegihting Pearson correlation
e.check_balance(X, T, out['w'])
```
